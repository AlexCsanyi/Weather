# Weather app
A weather app I built following a tutorial and modified it to match my needs.
I only used HTML, CSS and "Vanilla" Javascript (ES6).
The HTML is very simple - it has only a few sections; CSS is using Flexbox
JS: the app uses the free API by darksky (you can find out more here: https://darksky.net.
It collects data based on your geolocation (so the app will only work if you allow the site to access your location).
For the icons I used https://darkskyapp.github.io/skycons/ - it is open source and you just need to clone / download their repository.
